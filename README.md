# Retrospective Board

This project is a simple retrospective board UI like those used in Scrum. It allows the user to add a card to any of three categories, and each card can have its own text, its own upvotes and downvotes, and can be moved to any another column.

The purpose of this project is to showcase proficiency in React, specifically
the use of props, the State hook and lifting state.
